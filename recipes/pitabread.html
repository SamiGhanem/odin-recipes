    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      This is a great pita bread recipe I got from a friend who works at a great
      Greek restaurant here in my town. Slice pita in half
      <strong>and</strong> fill pockets with your favorite filling,
      <em>or</em> for dipping, cut into wedges and pan fry in a little olive
      oil.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1.25 cups warm water (100 to 110 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>3.5 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed - divided</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>0.25 cup vegetable shortening</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a mixing bowl and allow to stand until
        the yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Mix in 2 cups of flour,
        salt, and shortening; beat for 2 minutes with a fork. Stir in as much of
        the remaining 1 1/2 cup flour as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and
        elastic, kneading in more flour if dough is sticky. Form into a ball,
        cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest in a warm area for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into 12 equal portions; flour your hands and roll each
        piece into a ball. Cover dough balls with a kitchen towel and let rest
        for 10 minutes. Flatten the balls into rounds on a floured surface,
        cover with kitchen towel, and let rest 10 more minutes. Gently roll each
        dough ball into a circle about 6 inches in diameter on a floured
        surface. Place pita breads in a single layer on ungreased baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until the pita breads puff up, 3 to 4 minutes.
        Flip breads over with a spatula, return to oven, and bake 2 more
        minutes. Let cool on wire racks before cutting pita breads in half and
        gently separating tops and bottoms to form pockets for filling.
